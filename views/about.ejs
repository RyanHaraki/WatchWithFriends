  <h4>The Creator</h4>
  <p>
    WatchWithFriends was created by Ryan Haraki, a 17 year old highschool
    student from BC. During qurantine, I decided to really improve my
    programming skills and worked on learning different technologies in
    full-stack web development. This was my first personal project of relevance,
    and I hope you and your friends enjoy watcing videos together on it!
